# Filtering
Gaussian + Bilateral + Joint Bilateral Filtering Implementation in C++

### Summary
Here I included my implementation of Gaussian + Bilateral + Joint Bilateral Filtering in C++ and the library I used.
This implementation takes pfm files as input images. 
I also added two sets of filtered images for reference.
